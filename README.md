# EU-health
An econometric analysis of health outcomes across the EU to determine the (not necessarily causal) relationship between contributing factors such as alcohol consumption and avoidable mortality.

There are 2 files in the repo.

1 shows the data I collected on health outcomes and contributing factors.
The other shows the report I produced based on my econometrics analysis, a brief review of the literature and highlights the unreliability of insights that can be drawn when conducting high-level macroeconomic analysis on outcomes such as health.
